* What is JavaScript?:

JavaScript was created to make web pages interactive.
Scripts written in JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
Unlike Java, JavaScript does not require special preparation or compilation to run.

* History and Naming:

Initially named “LiveScript,” it was renamed to “JavaScript” to ride on the popularity of Java at the time.
Despite the name, JavaScript is entirely independent of Java and has its own specification called ECMAScript.

* Execution Environments:

JavaScript can run in various environments, not just browsers.
For example, Node.js allows JavaScript to run on servers.
Different browsers use different JavaScript engines (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).

* Capabilities:

In-browser JavaScript can manipulate web pages, interact with users, and communicate with servers.
It is a “safe” language, meaning it does not provide low-level access to memory or the CPU.

* JavaScript Engines:

JavaScript engines read, parse, and compile scripts into machine code,
optimizing the code at each step for better performance.

This introduction highlights JavaScript’s versatility and its evolution,
from a simple scripting language to a powerful tool for both client-side and server-side development.*/
